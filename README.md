## Short description
This repository contains write-ups and documentation for various security/hacking challenges (e.g. OWASP Juice Shop, Hack The Box, TryHackMe). Each solved challenge should include its own `README.md` with the objective, step-by-step solution, proof (flag/output), technical explanation and recommended remediation.
