## Project Handover  

📄 [Juice Shop Meister Checkliste PDF](<./Juice Shop Meister Checkliste.pdf>)

## Purpose

This repository exists purely for educational purposes. It is intended to support learning, ethical hacking, and security awareness through hands-on exploration of known vulnerabilities and challenge platforms.

---

## Short description
This repository contains write-ups and documentation for various security/hacking challenges (e.g. [OWASP Juice Shop](./OWASP-Juice-Shop/challenges/README.md), [Hack The Box](./Hack-The-Box/challenges/README.md), [TryHackMe](./TryHackMe/challenges/README.md)). Each solved challenge should include its own `README.md` with the objective, step-by-step solution, proof (flag/output), technical explanation and recommended remediation.
