# About OWASP Juice Shop

OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally insecure web application developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
It serves as a training ground for security enthusiasts, developers, and penetration testers to learn and practice web
application security in a safe and legal environment.

Juice Shop includes a wide range of vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top Ten and beyond, making it ideal for hands-on
learning, Capture the Flag (CTF) events, and security awareness training. Users are encouraged to explore, exploit, and document discovered issues to deepen their understanding of secure coding practices and common attack vectors.

The primary goal of the project is to promote security education through practical experience, helping individuals and teams
improve their skills in identifying and mitigating real-world security flaws.
